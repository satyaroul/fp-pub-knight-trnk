                <p>"Promoting a safe motorcycling culture through organised rides, events, and promotions, contributing to the improvement of the biking community and civic conditions of our society through impactful social responsibility initiatives."

                It all started in the fall of 2012 when a group of friends in Pune, with a sense of freedom, a love for their machines, and a burning passion to ride and explore, decided to take their passion to another level. 

                Our founding members were regular Royal Enfield owners who were inspired by the stories of the road and journeys that defined people and their lives. A Ride to conquer The Great Himalayas on their enfield motorcycles helped conceive the idea of forming a club which would get people with similar passion come together and celebrate and cherish an everlasting bond called "Brotherhood".

                King's Royal Riders Motorcycle Club has moved way beyond the concept of just riding for leisure and exploring new lands. The club has grown multifold and has taken upon itself the responsibility of promoting a safe riding culture, enhancing the riding community, providing a platform for all those who wish to bring out their urge to ride and reach out to untouched parts of this beautiful country.

                The Club stands witness to numerous stories, infinite experiences, tangible social impacts, and the strength of being committed to one's passion.</p>
